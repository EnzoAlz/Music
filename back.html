<!-- Figuring out how to format all my images was the most difficut part of creating this website. I had lots of difficulty trying to figure out how to correctly allign the image. I tried everything I could and it didn't work. I went to bootstrap and found I could just use text allign to make sure it was always below the text I wanted it to be below and it worked. -->
